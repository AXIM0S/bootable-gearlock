# GearLock integration with Android-x86 source

Currently patches are only available for nougat, oreo, pie and q.
Although other versions are supported by the `executable-gearlock-installer`.
Patch files for murshmellow and lolipop will be included later on.

### Just do

```bash
cd bootable
git clone https://github.com/AXIM0S/bootable-gearlock gearlock
```

You can also do `make -j4 gearlock` to only apply GearLock patches.

## Then build ISO.
